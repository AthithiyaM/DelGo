## DelGo
Training a computer (and myself) to play Go!

*Note: This project is a WIPâ€” cleaning up the code piece by piece and adding it to GitHub*


### Outline:
- Outlining the rules, board, and game logic
- Zobrist Hashing to speed up gameplay
- Creating a bot that can play against itself and other humans

### Coming Soon:
- Using Monte-Carlo Tree Search for selecting *better than random* moves
- Implementation of Neural Networks
- Deep Learning using game records
- Reinforcement Learning & Self-Play

Based off the book *Deep Learning and the Game of Go* by Max Pumperla and Kevin Ferguson
